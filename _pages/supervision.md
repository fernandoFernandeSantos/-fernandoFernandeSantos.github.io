# Student Supervision

## Do you want to join?

I am generally open to supervising new students who are **motivated**, **eager to learn**, and
**interested in computer architecture**. If you fit this description,
please feel free to contact me via email.

The topics I am willing to explore include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Reliability of parallel architectures: permanent, transient, and intermittent faults
- Radiation-induced effects on computers: soft error rates, accumulated dose, etc.
- Real-time applications: real-time GPUs, real-time constraints
- Processing in memory: reliability and optimization

## 2024
- **Raphael Dennis, Undergrad Internship**: Microarchitectural fault simulation for a commercial RISCV processor.
- **Leah, Undergrad Internship**: Fault simulation on CUDA-based applications.
- **Lucas Roquet, Ph.D. Student**: With a main focus on the dependability of Large Machine Learning Models on GPUs
- **Maxwell Pirtle, Master M1**: Studying the time predictability and Worst-Case Execution Time on NVIDIA GPUs
- **Mehdi, Master M2**: Assessing the reliability of UPMEM Processing Near Memory Accelerators

## 2023

- **Lucas Roquet, Master M2**: reliability and security of Vision Transformers
- **Melanie Romano, Undergrad internship**: Assessing the reliability of codes running on the Greenwaves GAP9 RISCV by fault simulation

## 2022

- **Lucas Roquet, Master M1**: Fault simulation on Vision Transformers

## 2021

- **Geronimo Veit Acosta, Final Computing Engineering Bachelor's work**: Implementing fault tolerance with
  reduced precision duplication with comparison. Co-supervised with professor Paolo Rech.
