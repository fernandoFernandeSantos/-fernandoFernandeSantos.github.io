I specialize in researching the reliability of parallel architectures, efficient hardening techniques, 
and mitigating radiation-induced effects. I started my academic journey with a Bachelor's in Computer Science 
from the Western Paraná State University. I then pursued a Master's and Ph.D. from the Federal University of 
Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. After completing my Ph.D., I moved to Rennes, France, to work as a postdoctoral researcher
in the MSCA-BIENVENÜE Postdoctoral Program in the INRIA TARAN team. Throughout my academic career, 
I have focused on understanding the impact of radiation on devices used in large-scale HPC centers 
and safety-critical applications.

Currently, I'm a researcher at INRIA Rennes in the
[Taran Group](https://team.inria.fr/taran/), where I explore the
fault tolerance and reliability aspects of RISCV and Deep Neural Networks accelerators.
This exciting work allows me to contribute to advancing these emerging technologies and
their applications across various domains. I am eager to share my journey, insights,
ongoing projects, and research publications with you through this personal website.
Stay tuned for updates and collaborations as we collectively push the boundaries of
knowledge in computer science, shaping more reliable and efficient computing systems.
