I'm Fernando Fernandes dos Santos, a researcher specializing in the reliability of parallel architectures, 
efficient hardening techniques, and mitigating radiation-induced effects.
My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Western Paraná State 
University, followed by a Master's and Ph.D. from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. 
Throughout my studies, I have focused on understanding the impact of radiation on devices used in 
large-scale HPC centers and safety-critical applications.

Currently, I am actively engaged in research at INRIA Rennes in the
[Taran Group](https://team.inria.fr/taran/), where I explore the 
fault tolerance and reliability aspects of RISCV and Deep Neural Networks accelerators. 
This exciting work allows me to contribute to advancing these emerging technologies and 
their applications across various domains. I am eager to share my journey, insights, 
ongoing projects, and research publications with you through this personal website. 
Stay tuned for updates and collaborations as we collectively push the boundaries of 
knowledge in computer science, shaping more reliable and efficient computing systems.
