Great news! Our paper "Understanding the Effects of Permanent Faults in GPU's Parallelism Management and Control Units"
has been accepted at The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC23).
I was a collaborator (third author) together Juan David Guerrero Balaguera, Josie Esteban Rodriguez Condia, and
Matteo Sonza Reorda from DAUIN - Politecnico di Torino and Paolo Rech from the University of Trento.
